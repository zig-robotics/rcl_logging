# Zig package for rcl_logging

**This repo is deprecated, please see the [zigros mono repo](https://github.com/zig-robotics/zigros) for updates.**
Maintaining individual repos paired with the zig package manager is too error prone.

This provides a zig package for the rcl_logging project.
This currently targets zig 0.13 and ROS Jazzy.

## Dependencies
This also brings in spdlog v1.x.
Since it's a header only library there's no zig package for it for now
